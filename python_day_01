--> Data types

name = 'Ram'                   # Name is a string variable
age = 21                       # age is a integer variable
height = 5.3                   # height is a float variable
is student = True              # Baloon value

print(name)
o/p = Ram

print(age)
o/p = 21

print(height)
o/p = 5.3

## Let's create function that 

cust_name = input("May i know your name :")
age = int(input("May i know your age :"))

cust_name_type = type(cust_name)
age_type = type(age)

print(f"cust_name data type:{cust_name_type} age data types: {age_type}")


--> Python operations

Python provides different types of operations
Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform mathematical operations:

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder)
// : Floor Division (integer result of division)
** : Exponentiation (power)

x = 2
y = 2

x+y = 4 # addition
x-y = 0 # subtraction
x*y = 4 # Multi
x/y = 1  # division
x == y  o/p = True

--> Comparison Operators

These operators compare two values and return a Boolean (True or False):

== : Equal
!= : Not equal
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to

x == y = True
x != y = False
x > y = False
x < y = False
x >= y = False
x <= y = False

--> Logical Operators

These operators combine multiple conditions:

and: Returns True if both statements are true.
or: Returns True if at least one statement is true.
not: Reverses the result (True becomes False, False becomes True).


# addition calcular mini project 1

# Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers from the user and performs 
# addition and return results.

a = input("enter a number:")
b = input("enter a number:")
c = a+b
print(f"Results = {c}")


Cart mini project -2

Create a ecommerce cart that takes which items they wanna buy
Ask for their name
How many qty they wanna buy
At what price they are buying
Show the total cart including $ sign

code:
a = input("Ask for their name:")
b = input("How many qty they wanna buy:")
c = input("At what price they are buying:")
d =  e*c
print(f"the total cart including $ sign = {d}")
